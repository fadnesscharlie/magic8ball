Hello! Thank you for coming!

This application is a magic 8 ball based around Stranger Things.

[The Project Outline](https://observablehq.com/@mike-mwk/stranger-things-magic-8-ball#answer)

## To start

```
Pull down this Repo to your local machine

Run: "npm install" to install all the packages and node modules

```

## Usage

Using this application is simple as pie!

We have a list of questions based on Stranger things, all you need to do is pick which one!

We have a Lucky button if you are feeling lucky in your decision!

## Results

We have 2 tables for you to see your data!

### Frequency Table(Left Table)

This table shows the frequency of each result:
- Answers
- Frequency
- The percentage of how often the show up(Make sure this 8 ball isnt cheating!)

### Prediction Table(Right Table)

This table shows the prediction of each question:
- prediction based on each question

Resources:

- [Sort array to find result](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8584902/get-the-closest-number-out-of-an-array)
<!-- 
Todo:

Make prediction pop up right away
css to space things out
better sort to get a better prediction
  Feels like prediciton is not right.
  When sorts run, the first prediction will pop up
  but the second will make it disappear, then works fine after that
